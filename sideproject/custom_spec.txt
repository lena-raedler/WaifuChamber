## Our Goals (goals denoted with + will be implemented if we have enough time)

We want to create a metroidvania style game. It will feature a mutable world, opening new pathways as you explore.

- 3 consecutive areas, each:
    - with its own tone (architecture, sprites, music, enemies etc)
    - with a handful of rooms each
    - a boss guarding an item / ability
    - more difficult than the previous area
    - containing save points
    - containing unlockable shortcuts leading back to the checkpoint (á la Hollow Knight/Salt and Sanctuary)
    + final area = first area with changes
- basic movement
    - running left / right
    - jumping
    - dropping from platforms
    - interacting with game entities (save points, doors etc)
    - dodge roll (with air dash being unlockable)
    - some form of consecutive jump (jump resets or double jump)
- main combat
    - melee and/or ranged
    - hitting enemies
    - getting hit by enemies
    - swappable special move
    - dodge / parry projectiles
- player character
    - gets stronger over the course of the game (XP / level-up)
    - can equip found items to further increase stats
- non-hostile NPCs
    - shopkeeper that take your hard earned currency
    + small questlines
    - a sort of safe hub with multiple NPCs
- enemies
    - attack the player character as it gets in range
    - variants with melee attacks
    - variants with ranged attacks
    - bosses are capable of using different attacks
    - late game bosses have multiple phases
- map
    - shows discovered rooms and their doorways
    - shows discovered save points
    - shows where the player is currently located
- game over
    - player dies
    - player defeats final boss
+ new game+
    + ability to restart the game after completion, keeping your equipment (sans key items) and scaling enemies accordingly
- main menu
    - options
        + fully rebindable keys
        + controller support
    - new game
    - load game
    - exit
- pause menu
    - access to options menu
    - shows player stats
    - inventory management
    - continue
    - go to main menu
- *internals*
    - cap the frame-rate at a reasonable number
    - timing related logic should be independent of the frame-rate, use a *time delta*



*** Those are the initial specifications of the game. They may be adjusted as we see fit. ***
